# Placeholder for Empty Folders

This repository contains several empty folders required for project structure.

## Why This File?
Git does not track empty folders, so we add this `README.md` or a `.gitkeep` file to ensure the folders are maintained in version control.

## What to Do?
- You can delete this file once the folder has actual content.
- If you want to keep empty folders, use a `.gitkeep` file instead.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** GitHub might hide folders with only `.gitkeep`, so adding a `README.md` makes them visible.
